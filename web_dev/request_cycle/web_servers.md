# What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux was designed to be open-ended and feature-minded. It was designed by a community, not one company, and is therefore open source.

Programs built on Linux abide by the philosophy that small is beautiful and that each program should do one thing well.

# In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A Virtual Private Server or VPS, is available computer space that mimics an actual server. The VPS runs its own operating system and users can support programs on the VPS. Today, companies sell parts of their available computer space as VPS. One example is Amazon Lightsail. VPS is less expensive than maintaining a server and it can expand as your needs expand. Users also have root access and support as they would with larger servers.

# Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

Running programs as the root gives the user authority to make changes to the operating system that could affect the functionality of the operating system and the VPS.
