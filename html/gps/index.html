What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags?
The html semantic tags help to divide the webpage into different parts to be used for different purposes. Webreaders, webcrawlers and browsers look for these tags to perform different functions. This can all be accomplished using class attributes in <div tags, but semantic tags provide better readability for screen readers.

Which ones do you see as most useful?
I see the nav semantic tag as most useful because it helps organize where we move around both inside and outside of the page.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser displays elements in descending order from top to bottom in the html file. For instructions on how to treat inline elements, the browser looks to the nested tags and attributes, and, any stylesheets such as CSS.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge?
I learned how to make snippets.

Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I already created a table snippet that I used for this exercise. It was very helpful.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you?
The most difficult concept was determining how to create a snippet using the prompts given in the "New Snippet" tool.

How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I can practice making different snippets. -->
