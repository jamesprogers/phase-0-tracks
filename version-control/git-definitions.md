# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
> Version control isolates versions of code by separating the versions into different branch folders in Git.
> Version control is useful in ensuring that:
  1. The master branch won't be affected by changes until you're ready to incorporate them.
  2. Many people can work on different versions of a master and not confuse each other
  3. It prevents bugs from causing a bad user experience for folks using the master

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
> A branch is a subfolder in Git to allows you to have version control of the code

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
> A commit is the act of committing a file to a Git folder or subfoler in order to save the changes made to the file. A good commit message describes what changes were made to the file.

* What is a merge conflict?
> A merge conflict occurs when two people made changes to the same code in a file. One person merges their code to the master and when the other attempts to merge their code to the master, a conflict occurs.
