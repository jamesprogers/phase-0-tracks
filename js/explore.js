// pseudocode a function that takes a string as a parameter and reverses the string. reverse("hello"), for example, should return "olleh"

//  implement your function in JavaScript

// Add driver code that calls the function in order to reverse a string of your choice (as long as it's not a palindrome!), and stores the result of the function in a variable

// Add driver code that prints the variable if some condition is true. The condition can be a silly one, like 1 == 1
