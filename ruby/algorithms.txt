Algorithm for using an elevator ("Elevator Algorithm":

- if ordinal of floor requested to go to is less than current floor or is "B", "L" or "G", if current floor is not "B", press down arrow
- Otherwise, select up arrow
- When elevator doors open, enter elevator
- turn 180 degrees to face door
- look left and then right up to 90 degrees on either side to identify elevator button panel
- If required floor is identified with a letter, push the button with that letter.
- Otherwise, push button on panel that is labeled with the number that corresponds to the ordinal floor you are required to go to. (ex: 2 for 2nd).
- identify monitor displaying numbers. The numbers will correspond to the ordinal floor the elevator is currently passing.
- When a) the monitor displays the number the corresponds to the button pressed for your floor and b) the elevator doors open, exit the elevator.


Walking the dog:

- place the dog's head through the loop of the leash so the loop sits around the dog's neck
- take one plastic bag from bureau drawer
- place plastic bag in back pocket
- hold leash with left hand at the end of the leash opposite the end around the dog's neck
- approach apartment door ("Apartment Door"):
  - unlock apartment door
  - open apartment door
  - walk through apartment door
  - close apartment door
  - lock apartment door
- 50 feet and turn left 90 degrees
- use elevator algorithm above to go to floor "G"
- once you have exited the elevator, turn left 90 degrees and walk 30 feet to the building door
- At building door ("Building Door"):
  - open the building door
  - hold door open and stand in place as dog walks through the door
  - walk through the door
- turn 90 degrees right and walk to the sidewalk corner ("Sidewalk Instruction)")
  - continue turning 90 degrees and walking to the sidewalk corner until you reach the building door
- if dog stops, you stop.
- if dog walks, you continue to proceed with sidewalk instruction
- if dog poops
  - remove plastic bag from back pocket
  - place plastic bag over right hand so hand is completely covered
  - pick up poop with right hand enclosed in plastic bag
  - enclose poop in plastic bag
  - hold plastic bag closed
  - proceed with sidewalk instruction
- if you find a trash can
 - place plastic bag in trash can
- if you reach building door
 - proceed with Building Door instruction
- walk 30 feet and turn right 90 degrees
- proceed with Elevator Algorithm to 4th Floor
- turn right and walk 100 feet
- proceed with Apartment Door
- remove leash from around dog's head
- place leash on hook 12 inches to the left of the door
- end
